# Go to the market
Going to the market, why would you do that?! It’s crowded, lots of stands offering similar products. Someone is shouting “Coup d’oueil … des framboises, les 2 pour 5 euros! » what did he just say ? Is that a good deal, anyway moving on…

It’s getting more and more crowded, I should have just ordered my vegetables online, but something draws me here. Is it to get better quality products, spend less money ? How do I know what to pay for a kilo of apples ?

I just want to get out of here with a caddie full of quality products and get on with my day!
